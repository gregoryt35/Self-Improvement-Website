            <h4>● Exercise</h4>
            <p>The first thing we urge everyone to do is some form of exercise. Exercise is essential, not only for the
                body, but for the mind as well. We recommend doing at least one physical activity each day. This could
                be anything,
                such as walking, running, swimming, biking, weight lifting, playing a sport, etc. As long as you are
                getting out there
                and being active, you are taking a step in the right direction.</p>

            <h4>● Clean eating</h4>
            <p>With so many options out there, from Big-Macs to donuts, one must be sure to maintain a healthy diet. One
                of the
                biggest issues that plague our society is unhealthy eating habits. It is imperative that you eat a
                well-balanced diet of
                nutritious foods, such as high-quality fruits, vegetables, meats, etc. Also, make sure to drink plenty
                of water. We understand
                that it may not be sustainable to eat
                clean all the time, so eating out on occassion is fine, as long as it does not become the main driver of
                your diet.
            </p>

            <h4>● Sleep</h4>
            <p>Sleep, something a lot of us can agree we do not get enough of. Despite this, sleep is arguably the most
                important
                thing to keep in check. Lack of sleep causes a myriad of issues, no matter how much you exercise or how
                clean your
                diet is. Medical professionals recommend anywhere from 7-9 hours of sleep per night for optimal health.
