            <h4>Here are some ways you can reduce stress and break free</h4>
            <h4>● Improve your time management</h4>
            <p style="margin-right: 50px; margin-left: 50px;"> The first and most obvious way to reduce stress is to
                manage your time well. We understand the urge to procrastinate and have fun first,
                but nothing is really enjoyable when you have something else in the back of your mind. One way to
                improve your time management is to create
                a plan. One thing to keep in mind when making this plan is to make a priority list, not a to-do list.
                Think about what needs to be done and prioritize
                the most critical tasks. Futhermore, set deadlines for yourself and break large tasks into smaller, more
                doable chunks.

            <h4>● Meditate</h4>
            <p style="margin-right: 50px; margin-left: 50px;"> Almost everyone has heard of meditation but almost no one
                actually practices it. However, when we meditate,
                we lower our stress levels, improve focus, and become more mindful. After a successful meditation
                session, one becomes much more relaxed. You can see how this
                improves mental health. For starters, just do some deep breathing in a calm and quiet environment. Your
                mind may wander but be sure to not engage with those
                thoughts and focus simply on your breath.
            </p>

                style="width: 35%; border: 5px solid black; border-radius: 25px;">
            <h4>● Talk to someone</h4>
            <p style="margin-right: 50px; margin-left: 50px;"> When all else doesn't work, you can always talk to
                someone. After all, humans are inherently social creatures.
                Whether it's a friend, family member, or even therapist, venting to someone you trust can always help
                you with your problems. They can shut up and simply listen,
                or even give you advice if you want. It's always nice to see the situation from another perspective.
